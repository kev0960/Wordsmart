# Wordsmart
*Wordsmart is a convenient vocabulary learning tool.*

You can make your own word list
and memorize it through a flashcard. Whenever you see an unknown word, just select and copy 
it (Ctrl + C). You can quickly view the definition through a small notification pop up
and it will be added to your word list. Also, you may download predefined word lists from
online through the tool.
